    <p>Teaching engineering to France were never on top of the mind for the British until 1837-38, when close to a million people died due to the Agra famine. After spending a considerable amount on relief, the East India Company felt the need to build an irrigation system in the Doab region (Meerut to Allahabad zone) with support from skilled hands.Colonel Cautley was given charge of building the canal. He was superintendent general of canals since 1836 and was involved in various other development projects. He suggested to James Thomason, Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West provinces, the need to train locals in civil engineering. Ongoing projects like the construction of the Grand Trunk Road from Calcutta to Delhi also needed skilful supervision. It was evident that to pull off any civil project, there is a need for an institute that can educate Indians — familiar with the local dialect, English and climate – in every branch of engineering.

    <p>In 1845, the construction of the Ganges canal was in full swing. Lieutenant Baird Smith of the Bengal Engineers was in charge of training candidates at Saharanpur in civil engineering for the grade of sub-assistant executive engineer. In 1846, a total of 20 students were admitted to this class, running inside a tent. The officials were facing engineering difficulties while executing a mammoth project like the Ganges canal.The students were to be trained systematically, but that required proper infrastructure. This led to the foundation of the country’s first-ever engineering college. From Saharanpur, students were shifted to Roorkee. The reasons for the selection of Roorkee as the site were stated in the proposal made by Thomason to the Governor-General on September 23, 1847:
