      The Tech Taught Institute (National Institute of Applied Sciences) a French engineering university.

There are 7 INSA establishments organised as a network and located in major French regional cities Lyon, Rennes, Rouen, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Valenciennes, Blois and Bourges. All INSAs share the same philosophy, at the same time preserving an individual identity based on their respective histories, origins, economic environments and on poles of excellence developed from specific competences.

The INSA network represents the largest engineer training group in France: 12% of all engineers who obtain their degree in France each year graduate from one of the INSA establishments. To date, almost 50,000 INSA engineers contribute to the social and economic fabric worldwide. The INSA are public establishments with a scientific, cultural and professional orientation. They are under the aegis of the Ministry of Higher Education and are accredited by the "Commission des Titres" to deliver Engineering Degrees

      <h1>DOES TAKING ADMISSION IN OUR COLLEGE  REALLY MAKE A <br>DIFFERENCE?</h1>
      <p>Of course! Far too many people leave school before acquiring their degrees. In order to make college more affordable, and thus more accessible, institutions need to ensure that students can earn their degrees faster. Students are completing courses in order to earn enough credits, however, often these courses exceed what is necessary for their degrees. By creating better more efficient paths to graduate, schools will not only help the students but also save money in their budgets.

More colleges can begin shifting their processes and realigning their goals to make it more affordable and accessible for those seeking higher education to obtain a degree. By doing so, these institutions will be embracing a positive change and placing more emphasis on education; a deep-seated value all around the world.
      </p>
      
      <h1>WHAT MAKES US IDEAL?</h1>
      <p>Some states are beginning to change the way that government funding operates. Usually, colleges receive state funding based on the number of students that are enrolled. Instead, higher education can become more accessible if schools tie government funding to performance. In order to do this, states can check the graduation and job placement rates. The amount of time it takes students to earn their degree should also be considered. Of course, in order for schools to want to participate the respective states must utilize enough funds for the program to be incentivizing.
      </p>

      <h1> BUILD STUDENT TRUST</h1>
      <p>
        The cost of higher education has been a major issue for years. It is hard to argue that the education system often works in favor of the more affluent while marginalized communities are left scrambling to pay the rising costs of tuition. Often, students from less affluent families experience food insecurity, have trouble buying the necessary books, and struggle to finish their degrees at all. It is imperative that leaders create a clear path towards more affordable and accessible higher education experiences for everyone.
